This is my story on how I was able to change my unhappy life and transform it into a happier, healthier, more fulfilling life. It was a fun journey for me as this is just the beginning of my new chapter in my life.

My main goal is to help some of you that have or had struggles (like me) to overcome your fears, failures and reach your highest potential. So, your remaining time in this life can be better  and you will be able to achieve anything you want in life.

Life is a learning experience but take it with a grain of salt.

Everyone has their own problems in life. Everyone’s journey is different but there would always be lessons to be learned. And once we acknowledge it and learn from it, we can understand and find a better approach on how to go about any obstacle the next time we encounter it.

One of my mentors (that I still listen and learn from to this day and moving forward) is Jim Rohn. As I will quote a lot of his great affirmations on this post. (I have a list of other great mentors that have taught me well here … ____) 

Okay, this is the moment you have been waiting for… So, let’s jump right into it.

Here is a list of things that have helped me and you can do too! (in no particular order):

Develop A Morning Routine

Everyone has a routine that works for them. Develop your own morning routine so that you can create a successful week. By develop these powerful morning habits, not only you will increase productivity, but you will also increase your self-esteem which bring happiness  

“Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.”

Once you have developed a morning routine, by applying this routine every day of your life, it will become a habit which turns into a lifestyle. A healthy, happy and more fulfilling lifestyle. This brings me to the next point, self-discipline.

Self-Discipline

The people who succeed in any situation have a pattern of what they do to succeed. Whether it’s in business context, relationship, doesn’t matter what the environment is. However, one thing in common that they all have is self-discipline. Success is nothing more than a few simple disciplines practiced every day.

“Everyone must choose one of two pains: The pain of discipline or the pain of regret.”

If you are one of the people who struggles with this, don’t worry. I have a solution for you: Start from the smallest things AND have interest in them. Do them good and Master them. Then move on to the next one. Everyone has to start somewhere right? Well, this is how I was able to start to better myself. You’ve got to take consistent, MASSIVE Action and only then you will begin to build unstoppable momentum towards your goal that no one could stop you from anything.

“Affirmations without discipline is the beginning of delusion.”

Let go of your anger, annoyance and resentment when avoidance is NOT an option.

Be Grateful

This has been a huge impact on my life as I am continually growing and learning. I start my morning every day by practicing gratitude. By going through this gratitude process, your brain will thrive, but you will also appreciate the things you already have. Otherwise, you will not be given the things that you really want.

“There’s no better opportunity to receive more than to be thankful for what you already have. Thanksgiving opens the windows of opportunity for ideas to flow your way.”

Identify Your Bad Lifestyle Habits and CHANGE them!

I used to complain and blame everything around me like my job, the government, the weather until I heard my mentor’s quote that really changed my life:

“For things you change, you have to change.”

Then, I used to procrastinate a LOT when I was in college because I was lazy and always feel overwhelmed when it comes to learning new things. Until I realized that once adulthood hits, nothing will be given to you anymore. If this is you, I have great news for you.

To overcome this, it’s quite simple and easy. Just break it down to few simple steps and make one step at a time. Discipline yourself to make just the first step… then the second… then the third and before you know it, this becomes systematic, you’ll build a momentum, and you will keep going! Say to yourself, “like I should do it? I could do it? and I will do it! No more would I let neglect let me down!” 

Start doing the push-ups. Make progressive progress every day. And you will realize that your self-esteem is getting higher and higher and you will be happier each day.
